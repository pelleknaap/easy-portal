Moderators, you can find the source code/proof of ownership on https://github.com/pelleknaap/easy-portal . 
I accidentally included a logo template by woodpunch graphics in the first version, if it's possible you can delete the first version? I've only used it as a demo, I've added a little disclaimer at the bottom of the page to clarify it. I'm not sure if it's allowed so just delete this resource if it isn't.

Welcome to the resource page of "Easy portal".
One of the goals of this portal is to provide a super smooth installation service. You can just drop all the files in your webhost folder and you're ready to go!

Features:
Performance: I've optimized everything as much as I can. This means that it'll have super fast load times. It has a 96 performance rating as you can see in the image. 
Measured with the Chrome audit tools.
Easy installation: you can just drag and drop all the files into your webhost folder.
Configurable: almost everything can be changed! You can find the default config file here: https://hastebin.com/eguzofomes.ini
Animations: there are smooth, built-in animations. Click on this link to see the animations : https://gyazo.com/09de2210845ce6af1a1f04781e9b4efa
Particles: to make the portal more engaging, I've added particles to the background. You can change the size of the particles in the config.
Unlimited icons: you can add as many icons as you want! Just make sure you update the [PHP]amount_of_icons[/PHP] field in the config.

To do:
A box with the ip, click to copy.
A playercount
If you have any suggestions on what I could add in the next update, please give them in the discussions :)

NOTE: The logo used in the demo images isn't owned by me. It's a template made by https://woodpunchsgraphics.com/ it's only used to demostrate the portal.

You need to add a logo file yourself, it isn't included in the download!
